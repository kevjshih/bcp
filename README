REQUIREMENTS
Matlab 
apache ant
git
C compiler for compiling mex files
At least 12G of RAM

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run setup.m from the base directory. This will recompile compile all necessary files.
2. Edit init/BDglobals.m . 
   Set VOCyear to the Pascal VOC year number (default 2010)
   Set DATADIR to point to superdirectory holding Pascal dataset and precomputed object proposals
3. Download the Pascal dataset
   The file path should look like:
   ${DATADIR}/VOC2010/VOCdevkit/[VOCcode, results, VOC2010]
4. Download precomputed object proposals (vision.cs.uiuc.edu/proposals)
   Extract into DATADIR. The file path should look like:
   ${DATADIR}/proposals/VOC2010/

EXECUTION

Execute the MATLAB environment in the base directory. This will automatically run startup.m to setup the required paths. Make sure no errors/warnings show up.

The java.opts file controls the amount of memory allocated to JVM. Make sure at least 4-5G of RAM is allocated if DO_TRAIN_BOOSTING_AND_EVALUATE = 1. However, because memory allocated this way will be unavailable to regular MATLAB operations, it is recommended to disable this flag and reduce memory allocated to JVM first while training the part-detectors (everything else in part_refinement_final.m).
